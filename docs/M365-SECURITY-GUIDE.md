# Microsoft 365 Security Guide for DevMemory

## Overview

DevMemory's Microsoft 365 integration is designed with enterprise security as a top priority. This guide outlines the security architecture, data handling practices, and compliance features to help IT administrators and security teams understand and validate the solution.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

#### MSAL-Electron Implementation
- **Authorization Code + PKCE Flow** - Industry standard for desktop applications
- **No Client Secrets** - Enhanced security for public clients
- **Conditional Access Support** - Respects organizational policies
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Full MFA requirement compliance
- **Device Compliance** - Works with Intune device policies

#### Token Management
```yaml
Token Storage:
  - Location: Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain
  - Encryption: Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)
  - Scope: User-specific, machine-bound
  - Lifetime: Follows Azure AD token policies
  - Refresh: Automatic with secure refresh tokens
```

#### Permissions Model
```yaml
Microsoft Graph API Permissions (Read-Only):
  User.Read:           # Basic profile information
    - Display name, email, job title
    - Department and office location
    - No sensitive personal data
  
  Mail.Read:           # Email content access
    - Subject, sender, recipients
    - Body content for knowledge extraction
    - No email forwarding or sending
  
  Calendars.Read:      # Calendar information
    - Meeting details, participants
    - Location and time information
    - No calendar modification capabilities
  
  Files.Read.All:      # SharePoint and OneDrive
    - Document content and metadata
    - Site information and structure
    - No file modification or deletion
  
  Team.ReadBasic.All:  # Teams information
    - Team names and descriptions
    - Channel information
    - No message content or private data
  
  Organization.Read.All: # Organizational context
    - Company information
    - Directory structure (public)
    - No detailed user directory access
```

## Data Handling & Privacy

   HTTPS/TLS 1.3          Memory Processing         Local Storage
   Enterprise Auth        Entity Extraction         No Cloud Sync
   Audit Logging          Relationship Mapping      User-Controlled
```

### Data Processing Principles

#### Local-First Architecture
- **No Cloud Storage** - All M365 data processed and stored locally
- **On-Device Processing** - Entity extraction and analysis on user machine
- **No Data Transmission** - Processed data never leaves the local environment
- **User Control** - Complete control over data retention and deletion

#### Data Minimization
- **Content Filtering** - Only extracts relevant business context
- **Metadata Focus** - Emphasizes relationships over raw content
- **Configurable Scope** - Users can limit which content types to sync
- **Time-Based Limits** - Configurable retention periods

#### Data Classification Respect
```yaml
M365 Sensitivity Labels:
  Highly Confidential: Excluded from processing
  Confidential:        Limited metadata only
  Internal:            Standard processing
  Public:              Full processing enabled

Information Rights Management (IRM):
  Protected Content:   Respects IRM policies
  Access Controls:     Honors document permissions
  Expiration:          Respects content expiration
```

## Compliance & Governance

### Enterprise Policy Compliance

#### Conditional Access
- **Device Compliance** - Honors Intune device policies
- **Location Restrictions** - Respects IP/location-based access
- **Risk-Based Access** - Integrates with Azure AD Identity Protection
- **Session Controls** - Complies with Cloud App Security policies

#### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- **Policy Awareness** - Respects M365 DLP classifications
- **Content Scanning** - Avoids processing DLP-protected content
- **Alert Integration** - Can trigger DLP alerts for compliance monitoring
- **Audit Trail** - Maintains access logs for DLP investigation

#### Information Governance
```yaml
Retention Policies:
  - Respects M365 retention labels
  - Honors legal hold requirements
  - Supports eDiscovery processes
  - Maintains audit trail

Data Subject Rights (GDPR):
  - Data portability support
  - Right to erasure compliance
  - Data processing transparency
  - Consent management integration
```

### Audit & Monitoring

#### Access Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "user": "user@company.com",
  "action": "m365_sync_start",
  "resource_type": "email",
  "items_processed": 25,
  "permissions": ["Mail.Read"],
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "device_id": "device-123",
  "compliance_state": "compliant",
  "conditional_access": "satisfied"
}
```

#### Security Monitoring
- **Failed Authentication Attempts** - Logged and reported
- **Permission Changes** - Tracked and audited
- **Unusual Access Patterns** - Anomaly detection and alerts
- **Data Export Events** - Monitored for compliance

## Network Security

### Communication Security
```yaml
Transport Security:
  - TLS 1.3 for all communications
  - Certificate pinning for Graph API
  - HSTS enforcement
  - Perfect Forward Secrecy

Endpoint Security:
  - Microsoft Graph API endpoints only
  - No third-party data transmission
  - Regional endpoint support
  - VPN/proxy compatibility
```

### Firewall Requirements
```yaml
Outbound HTTPS (443) to:
  - graph.microsoft.com          # Graph API
  - login.microsoftonline.com    # Authentication
  - *.msauth.net                 # MSAL endpoints
  - *.microsoft.com              # Additional services

No Inbound Connections Required:
  - Application operates as client only
  - No listening ports
  - No peer-to-peer communication
```
