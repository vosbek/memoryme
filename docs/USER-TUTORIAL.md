- And more...

**Content**: Add the main content of your memory
```markdown
Example:
# React useEffect Best Practices

## Key Rules
1. Always include dependencies in the dependency array
2. Use cleanup functions for subscriptions
3. Split effects by concern

## Example
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = api.subscribe(handleData);
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [api]); // Include dependencies
```
```

### Step 3: Add Tags and Metadata

**Tags**: Add relevant tags to help categorize your memory
```
Examples: react, hooks, useEffect, javascript, frontend
```

**Metadata**: Fill in additional context
- **Source**: Where this came from (documentation, colleague, experiment)
- **Project**: Related project name
- **URL**: Link to documentation or resources
- **Author**: Person who shared this knowledge

### Step 4: Save Your Memory

Click **"Save"** or press `Ctrl+S`. Your memory is now saved and will be:
- Stored in the local SQLite database
- Processed for semantic search using ChromaDB
- Analyzed for entity and relationship extraction
- Added to your personal knowledge graph
