Thank you for your interest in contributing to DevMemory! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ Project Overview

DevMemory is an enterprise developer memory assistant that combines:
- Local vector database for semantic search
- LLM integration via AWS Bedrock
- VSCode integration for context capture
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Team collaboration features

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.8+ (for Chroma vector database)
- Git
- AWS account with Bedrock access (for LLM features)
- Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows) or Xcode (macOS)

### Development Setup
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure AWS credentials
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`

### Project Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/           # Electron main process
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ renderer/       # React frontend
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/         # Shared utilities and types
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Commit Convention
Use conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(search): add semantic search with embeddings
fix(ui): resolve memory editor save button issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
```

```

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # Coverage report
```

### Test Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- E2E tests for critical user workflows
- Minimum 80% code coverage
