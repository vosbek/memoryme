```

## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. High-Severity Security Vulnerabilities
```bash
# CRITICAL: 3 high-severity vulnerabilities in electron-builder
# CVE: GHSA-r4pf-3v7r-hh55 (Windows NSIS installer code execution)

Affected Components:
- app-builder-lib <24.13.2
- dmg-builder 5.0.0 - 24.13.1  
- electron-builder 19.25.0 || 20.24.0 - 24.13.1

Immediate Action Required:
npm audit fix --force
# OR update package.json:
"electron-builder": "^24.13.2"
```

### 2. Dependency Conflicts
```bash
# ESLint version conflicts preventing clean npm install
# Affects development and build reliability

Current Issue:
eslint@9.30.1 conflicts with eslint-plugin-react-hooks@4.6.2

Temporary Workaround:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

Permanent Fix Required:
Update eslint-plugin-react-hooks to v5.x or downgrade eslint to v8.x
```

### 3. Build Performance Issues
```yaml
Build Time Analysis:
  React Build: ~75 seconds (acceptable)
  Electron Build: >120 seconds (requires optimization)
  
Recommendations:
  - Implement incremental builds
  - Add build caching
  - Optimize webpack configuration
  - Consider esbuild migration
```

## üìÅ Data Storage & Privacy Architecture

### Local Data Storage Locations
```powershell
# Primary data directory (Windows)
%APPDATA%\DevMemory\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ devmemory.db          # SQLite database (structured data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chromadb/             # Vector embeddings (ChromaDB)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chroma.sqlite3    # ChromaDB metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.parquet         # Vector index files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ m365-config/          # Microsoft 365 settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                 # Application logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backups/              # Automatic backups (if enabled)

# Configuration files
%APPDATA%\DevMemory\config\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app-config.json       # Application settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-preferences.json # UI preferences
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ m365-tokens.encrypted # Encrypted M365 tokens
```

### Data Security Implementation
```yaml
Encryption at Rest:
  SQLite Database: File system level (Windows BitLocker recommended)
  M365 Tokens: Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)
  ChromaDB: Unencrypted (enhancement needed)
  
Access Control:
  File Permissions: Windows user-level isolation
  Process Security: Electron sandbox enabled
  Memory Protection: ASLR and DEP enabled

Privacy Guarantees:
  - All processing happens locally
  - No data transmitted to external servers (except M365 Graph API)
  - M365 data respects sensitivity labels
  - User has full control over data retention
```

### Data Volume Planning
```yaml
Typical Data Growth:
  SQLite Database: 10-50MB per user per year
  Vector Embeddings: 100-500MB per user per year
  M365 Cache: 50-200MB per user (configurable)
  
Enterprise Scaling:
  100 Users: ~65GB total storage
  1000 Users: ~650GB total storage
  Network Impact: Minimal (local processing)
```

## üîê Microsoft 365 Integration Setup

### Azure AD App Registration (IT Administrator)
```yaml
Required Configuration:
  Application Type: Public client (mobile & desktop)
  Authentication: 
    - Redirect URI: http://localhost
    - Allow public client flows: Yes
    - Supported account types: Single tenant (recommended)
  
  API Permissions (Delegated):
    Minimum Required:
      - User.Read
      - Mail.Read  
      - Calendars.Read
      - Files.Read.All
    
    Full Feature Set:
      - User.ReadBasic.All
      - Sites.Read.All
      - Chat.Read
      - OnlineMeetings.Read
      - People.Read
      - Directory.Read.Basic

Security Configuration:
  Admin Consent: Required for organization
  Conditional Access: Fully supported
  MFA: Enforced automatically
  Device Compliance: Intune compatible
```

### User Configuration
```powershell
# Method 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_CLIENT_ID", "your-client-id", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_AUTHORITY", "https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id", "User")

# Method 2: Application Settings
# Configure in DevMemory > Settings > Microsoft 365 Integration
```

### Authentication Flow
```yaml
Process:
  1. User clicks "Connect to Microsoft 365"
  2. System browser opens with company login page
  3. User completes enterprise authentication (MFA if required)
  4. Tokens stored securely using Windows DPAPI
  5. Refresh tokens handle automatic renewal

Current Limitation:
  Interactive flow requires manual browser completion
  Enterprise SSO automation planned for future release
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Methods & Procedures

### Method 1: Pre-built Installer (Production Recommended)
```powershell
# Download and verify installer
$installer = "DevMemory-Setup-1.0.3.exe"
# Verify digital signature (when available)
Get-AuthenticodeSignature $installer

# Silent installation for enterprise deployment
.\DevMemory-Setup-1.0.3.exe /S /D="C:\Program Files\DevMemory"

# Verification
if (Test-Path "C:\Program Files\DevMemory\DevMemory.exe") {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Installation successful"
} else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Installation failed"
    exit 1
}
```

### Method 2: Source Build (Development/Testing)
```powershell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/enterprise/devmemory.git
cd devmemory

# Install dependencies (with workaround for conflicts)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Installation Issues

#### Issue: npm install fails with dependency conflicts
```powershell
# Symptom: ERESOLVE errors during npm install
# Root Cause: ESLint version conflicts with React hooks plugin

# Immediate Fix:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Permanent Fix:
# Update package.json to resolve version conflicts
npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks@^5.0.0
# OR downgrade ESLint
npm install eslint@^8.57.0
```

#### Issue: Build process times out or fails
```powershell
# Symptom: Build takes >2 minutes or fails with memory errors
# Solutions:
# 1. Increase Node.js memory limit
set NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096

# 2. Use incremental builds
npm run build:react && npm run build:electron

# 3. Clear cache and retry
npm run clean && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build
```

#### Issue: ChromaDB connection failures
```powershell
# Symptom: Vector database initialization fails
# Solutions:
# 1. Verify Python installation
python -c "import chromadb; print('ChromaDB available')"

# 2. Reinstall chromadb
pip uninstall chromadb
pip install chromadb>=1.9.2

# 3. Check permissions on data directory
icacls "%APPDATA%\DevMemory"
```

### M365 Integration Issues

#### Issue: Authentication loops or failures
```yaml
Check List:
  ‚ñ° Azure AD app registration configured correctly
  ‚ñ° Redirect URI set to http://localhost
  ‚ñ° Admin consent granted for organization
  ‚ñ° User has permissions to consent to applications
  ‚ñ° Conditional Access policies allow the application
  ‚ñ° "Allow public client flows" enabled in Azure AD

Debug Steps:
  1. Check application logs in %APPDATA%\DevMemory\logs
  2. Verify network connectivity to Microsoft endpoints
  3. Test authentication outside of conditional access
  4. Clear stored credentials and retry
```

#### Issue: M365 data sync failures
```yaml
Common Causes:
  - Token expiration (should auto-refresh)
  - Permission changes in Azure AD
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Rate limiting from Microsoft Graph

Resolution Steps:
  1. Refresh authentication tokens
  2. Verify API permissions in Azure AD
  3. Check rate limiting status
  4. Test with incremental sync
```

### Performance Issues

#### Issue: High memory usage or slow performance
```powershell
# Monitoring commands
Get-Process DevMemory | Select-Object CPU, WorkingSet, Handles
Get-Counter "\Process(DevMemory)\Working Set" -MaxSamples 10

# Common solutions
# 1. Restart application (memory leak mitigation)
# 2. Clear vector database cache
Remove-Item -Recurse "%APPDATA%\DevMemory\chromadb\cache"

# 3. Optimize database
# Run VACUUM on SQLite database through application settings
```
